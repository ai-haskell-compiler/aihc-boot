-- | What an optimization level asks for, as a plan.
--
-- A level names a purpose: finish quickly, optimize each module, produce
-- fast code, or produce a small executable. 'optimizationPlan' expands
-- it once, at the command line, into the scope of the build, the System FC
-- passes to run, and the GRIN analyses to run. Everything downstream reads the plan, and no
-- pass reads the level. The level itself still reaches Clang, and it is
-- part of the identity of an installed package.
--
-- See @docs/optimization.md@.

    -- per-module scope, and on the merged program at a whole-program
    -- scope.

-- | The plan of a level, under the @--lto@ flag.
--
-- @-O0@ runs nothing. @-Os@ runs the shrinking inliner. @-O1@ and @-O2@
-- run the shrinking inliner and then the growing one, so that @-Os@ is
-- a prefix of @-O2@ and the growing phase starts from the program that
-- @-Os@ would have produced. Eta expansion runs before the inliner, so
-- that a value it turns into a function is a saturated call for the
-- inliner to take, and again after it, because a call of a class method
-- hides the arity of the method until the selection is inlined. One
-- simplifying walk then reduces the applications and casts the second
-- expansion leaves behind.
--
-- @-O2@ and @-Os@ compile the whole program; @--lto@ asks for the same
-- scope at the other levels without changing their passes. @-O2@ and @-Os@
-- also run the heap points-to analysis of GRIN on the whole program. Each of
-- its rewrites removes code or replaces a runtime dispatch with a direct
-- jump, so it serves a small executable as well as a fast one.
