-- | Whole-program compilation for @--lto@ builds.

-- A @--lto@ install stops each module at System FC. @build@ reads the
-- System FC of every module of the program, from the installed packages and
-- the executable alike, merges it into one program, and lowers that program
-- through GRIN and Lir to one object.
