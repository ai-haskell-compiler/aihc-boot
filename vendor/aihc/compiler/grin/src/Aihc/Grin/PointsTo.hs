-- | Heap points-to analysis of a whole GRIN program, and the rewrites that
-- its result permits.
--
-- The analysis finds, for each pointer variable, the set of heap locations
-- that the variable can point at. A location is a place in the program that
-- makes a heap node: a @store@, a binding of a @store-rec@, an @apply@ that
-- makes a partial application, a global, or the shared object of a nullary
-- constructor. The analysis also finds the nodes that each location can hold
-- and, for each field of such a node, the locations that the field can point
-- at. It is the analysis of Boquist's GRIN thesis, in the inclusion-based
-- form of Andersen's analysis.
--
-- Two special locations stand for heap objects that the program cannot see:
-- 'unknownLocation', which can be a thunk, and 'unknownValueLocation', which
-- is in weak-head normal form. A value that a primitive, a foreign call, or
-- the runtime gives has one of them. A value that goes to such code escapes:
-- the code can evaluate it, apply it, and read its fields. A public global
-- escapes, because another unit can name it. A whole program has one public
-- global, its entry, so the analysis sees nearly all of it.
--
-- The solver is sequential. Each variable, parameter, result, and node field
-- is a set node. A copy is an edge between two set nodes. An @eval@, an
-- @apply@, a @case@, and a @fetch@ are triggers on the set node of their
-- operand: each location that reaches the operand can add edges and
-- locations. The worklist gives each set node only the locations that are
-- new to it. The solver does not merge cycles.
--
-- The rewrites use the result:
--
-- * A case alternative whose constructor no location of the scrutinee holds
--   is dead. The rewrite removes it.
--
-- * An @eval@ of a variable whose locations are all in weak-head normal form
--   is the variable itself.
--
-- * An @apply@ whose function can only be a closure of one function, with
--   one argument left, is a @fetch@ of the stored fields and a direct call.
--
-- * An @eval@ whose thunks no other evaluation can reach needs no update
--   frame. The rewrite makes it an 'EvalSingleEntry' evaluation.
--
-- The last rewrite needs a sharing analysis. A location is shared when two
-- references to one of its nodes can exist: a variable that points at it has
-- two uses, a shared node or an escaped node holds it in a field, or it is
-- the result of a shared thunk. A thunk whose location is not shared is
-- evaluated at most one time. Delimited continuations can resume a
-- computation more than one time, so a program that captures one gets no
-- single-entry evaluations.
