{-# LANGUAGE OverloadedStrings #-}

-- | Which primitives allocate.
--
-- A heap reservation may span any operation that leaves the reservation
-- alone. Most primitives do: arithmetic, comparisons, bit operations, the
-- accesses of memory that is already allocated, and the runtime calls that
-- only read or copy, such as the floating-point library functions and the
-- array copies. The primitives named here are the ones that make a new
-- object, so a reservation must not reach across them.
--
-- The allocation classification includes both movable and pinned objects.
-- Both forms consume a prior reservation in the shared heap budget.
--
-- 'Aihc.Native' records how each primitive is lowered, but sits above GRIN
-- and cannot be read from this side, so this list is a second statement of
-- what those tables imply. The test suite holds the two together: every
-- primitive that is handed the machine pointer, and so can reach
-- @aihc_gc_allocate@, has to appear here, and nothing may appear here that
-- is not a runtime call at all. Getting it wrong is quiet -- a primitive
-- that allocates outside a reservation aborts inside @aihc_gc_allocate@
-- rather than failing a lint -- which is why the list is checked rather
-- than trusted.
