-- | Static reference tables for GRIN functions.
--
-- The collector cannot keep every static object alive forever without also
-- keeping everything an evaluated CAF retains. A function's static reference
-- table names the static objects the function's code can reach without going
-- through a heap object, so the collector can mark exactly those objects when
-- the function is running and when one of its closures is traced.
--
-- Tables are chained instead of flattened: a table names the tables of the
-- functions it calls directly, and the runtime walks that graph. The reachable
-- set is therefore the same as a transitive closure, but the compiler never
-- computes one, every reference stays an ordinary relocation, and the analysis
-- does not need the whole program.
--
-- A function also needs the tables of objects that it can create.
-- A collection can occur before allocation, when no object carries those tables.
-- This rule also applies to continuation closures from CPS conversion.

-- | Whether the collector has to mark one static object.
--
-- Marking an object does two things: it scans the object's fields, and it
-- walks the static reference table on the object's info table. An object needs
-- marking when either of those can matter.
--
-- Closures and thunks always need it, because they carry code and therefore a
-- table. A static closure with no captured fields still names the static
-- objects its entry function reaches, and nothing else will walk that table
-- while the closure is only waiting to be entered.
--
-- A constructor has no code, so it matters only when it has fields at all.
-- That leaves nullary constructors, which can neither move nor retain
-- anything, out of the collector's bookkeeping entirely.
--
-- The constructor test is deliberately the field count rather than the field
-- representations. The collector follows the info table's pointer bitmap, and
-- a constructor's bitmap comes from the declared layout rather than from the
-- values this particular object stores. Marking every object that has fields
-- leaves that one decision with the bitmap, at the cost of scanning the
-- occasional static node whose fields are all unboxed.

-- mentions a static object another module defines and this program knows
-- nothing about. Such an object must still be named, or nothing would keep an
-- imported CAF alive. A name is therefore dropped only when this program
-- defines the object and knows it needs no marking; anything else is named,
-- and the collector decides at run time whether the address is one it tracks.
