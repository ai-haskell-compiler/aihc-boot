-- | Keep the declarations that one of the roots reaches, and drop the rest.
-- A root that the program does not declare has no effect.
--
-- Reachability is over every declared name, not only the names of values.
-- A type declaration carries one name for the type and one for each of its
-- constructors, and the two are reached apart: a value whose type mentions
-- @Maybe@ needs the header of @Maybe@, because that is where the kind that
-- decides the runtime representation lives, and needs no constructor of it.
-- A constructor is reached only where an expression builds it or a case
-- alternative matches it, so a type whose constructors nothing names keeps
-- its header alone and its constructor info tables go away.
--
-- Two references are not written in the program and hold all the same:
-- a constructor keeps the type it belongs to, and a type family keeps every
-- equation of the family, because 'Aihc.Fc.TypeOf.reduceType' finds an
-- equation by matching the head of its left side and never by name.
--
-- The imports are roots as well. They are not pruned here, and an import
-- whose type mentions a declaration of this program has to keep it.
