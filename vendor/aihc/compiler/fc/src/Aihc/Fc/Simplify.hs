{-# LANGUAGE OverloadedStrings #-}

-- | The System FC simplifier: the local rewrites of one expression.
--
-- The simplifier walks a body once and applies the rewrites that need no
-- copy of a callee, or that the inliner asks for with a copy in hand: a
-- lambda applied to an argument, a let in the head of an application, the
-- case of a known constructor or literal, a case on a comparison with a
-- literal, a strict pure primitive call bound twice, a case whose
-- default alternative is a case on the same value, a case of a case with
-- join points, and a cast against its symmetry.
--
-- A copy of a candidate at a use site is one of its rewrites. The
-- 'Simpl' environment carries the candidates and the site policy that
-- the inliner gives it; 'simplifyProgram', the standalone pass, gives it
-- none. The decision about which values are candidates, and the walk
-- over the call graph, belong to "Aihc.Fc.Inline".
--
-- Tidied programs reuse local names across sibling scopes, so every copy
-- that moves into another scope gets binders with uniques above the
-- program's largest, and the pass ends with 'tidyProgram'.
