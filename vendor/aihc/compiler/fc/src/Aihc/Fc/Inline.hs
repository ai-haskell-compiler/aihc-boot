-- | Inline the value declarations of one System FC program.
--
-- The inliner follows the non-recursive inliner of MLton. It walks the
-- value declarations from the leaves of the call graph to the roots. At
-- each use of a non-recursive value it puts a copy of the body in place,
-- simplifies the copy with "Aihc.Fc.Simplify", and keeps the result when
-- the policy accepts the site. A value that nothing uses after this is
-- dropped when the program does not need to keep it.
--
-- Every decision is local. A site is accepted from the callee, the
-- arguments at the site, and the value the site sits in; nothing depends
-- on what the walk did to any other value. The 'InlinePolicy' names the
-- limits, and the program as a whole has no budget: each accepted site
-- adds at most the callee limit, each value grows at most to its own
-- multiple, recursive groups are never copied into themselves, and the
-- rounds are counted, so the growth of the program is bounded by
-- construction.
--
-- The desugarer already gives each dictionary method its own top-level
-- worker, so a dictionary is a small constructor application and a class
-- method applied to a known dictionary reduces to a direct call.
