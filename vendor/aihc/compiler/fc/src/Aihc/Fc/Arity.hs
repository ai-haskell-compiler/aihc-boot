-- | Arity analysis and eta expansion for System FC.
--
-- A top-level value whose body is not a lambda is a CAF: the backend gives
-- it a thunk, and every use enters that thunk. That is right for a shared
-- result and wrong for a function, and in System FC the two are easy to
-- confuse, because a newtype hides the arrow. @IO@ is the case that
-- matters:
--
-- > val writeOk :: IO Int
-- >  = let length = I# 3# in thenIO (hPutBuf stdout "ok\n" length) (...)
--
-- @IO a@ is a newtype of @State# RealWorld -> (# State# RealWorld, a #)@,
-- so this value is a function of one argument wearing a coercion. This
-- pass finds that out and eta expands the body to
--
-- > val writeOk :: IO Int
-- >  = (λ(s : State# RealWorld). (let length = ... in thenIO ...) ▷ co s)
-- >      ▷ sym co
--
-- which the GRIN lowering compiles to a function, not a thunk.
--
-- == The analysis
--
-- The arity of a body is /not/ read off its type. @typeArity@ says how
-- many arrows the type can expose, and that is only a ceiling: it says
-- what an expansion is able to do, never what it is allowed to do. Taking
-- it as the answer would eta expand
--
-- > f = λa. let expensive = ... in λb. ...
--
-- to two arguments and recompute @expensive@ on every call, where before
-- a partial application @f x@ shared it.
--
-- So the arity comes from 'arityType', which walks the body and returns
-- one entry per lambda it could expose, each carrying
--
--   * the 'Cost' of the work that would have to move inside that lambda,
--     and
--   * whether the lambda is 'OneShot'.
--
-- 'safeArityType' then cuts the list at the first lambda that is both
-- preceded by expensive work and not one-shot. Cheap work may always move
-- inward; expensive work may move under a one-shot lambda, because a
-- one-shot lambda is entered at most once per closure, so nothing is
-- repeated. A lambda over @State# RealWorld@ is taken to be one-shot --
-- GHC's state hack, which is what makes @IO@ code expand at all.
--
-- This mirrors @GHC.Core.Opt.Arity@: 'arityType', 'arityLam', 'arityApp',
-- 'floatIn', 'addWork', 'safeArityType' and 'trimArityType' are the same
-- functions under the same names. What is missing here is divergence:
-- GHC tracks a bottoming body so that @λx. error "..."@ gets the arity of
-- its type, and it needs @Note [State hack and bottoming functions]@ to
-- stop that looping. This pass never claims arity from a diverging body,
-- which costs some expansion and needs no such guard.
--
-- Casts are transparent to the analysis, exactly as in GHC, because a
-- coercion has no run-time content: it is the whole reason
-- @thenIO :: IO a -> IO b -> IO b@, whose body is @λx. λy. (λs. ...) ▷ co@,
-- has arity three rather than two.
