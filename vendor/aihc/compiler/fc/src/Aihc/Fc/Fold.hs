-- | Fold a primitive applied to literals.
--
-- The inliner substitutes trivial bindings and reduces known cases, which
-- leaves primitive calls whose every operand is a literal: @int2Word# 0#@
-- in a constructor field, or @x <# 10#@ after @x@ became a literal. This
-- module computes such a call at compile time. A folded comparison is a
-- literal scrutinee, so the case that consumed it reduces next.
--
-- Only a total primitive with one result is folded. A division by zero
-- and a shift by the width or more stay as calls, since the machine
-- decides what those give. The value of every folded primitive is defined
-- by the GRIN interpreter; the property test holds this table to it.
--
-- 'foldPrimitive' knows nothing about System FC: a literal is its
-- runtime representation, named as GHC names it, and its value. The
-- representations are the same names that the interpreter and the
-- lowering read, so a mismatch between a literal and the primitive it
-- reaches is a refusal to fold rather than a wrong result.
