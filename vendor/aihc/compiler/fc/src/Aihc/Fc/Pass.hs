-- A plan of optimization is a list of passes. Each pass is a pure
-- function from a program to a program and a report, and 'runPass' runs
-- one with the roots of the scope it runs in: the public values of a
-- module, or the entry of a whole program. No pass reads the
-- optimization level; the level chooses the list, once, at the command
-- line.
