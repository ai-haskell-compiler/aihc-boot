-- Module      : Aihc.PackagePlan.Solver
-- Description : Choose one version and one flag assignment per package
--
-- The solver turns the @build-depends@ of a set of root packages into an
-- assignment of exactly one version and one flag assignment to every
-- package the build needs. It is a function of its inputs alone: the
-- candidates of each package and their cabal files arrive through
-- 'SolverInputs', which a test instantiates with pure maps and the compiler
-- with the Hackage index.
--
-- The search is conflict-directed backjumping over goals. A goal is a
-- package name with the range its dependents demand; the goal with the
-- fewest candidates is decided first, its candidates are tried newest
-- first with deprecated versions last, and within a version the flag
-- assignments are tried default first and then in increasing number of
-- flips. A candidate whose dependency list contradicts a package already
-- assigned is rejected, and a goal with no candidates left returns to the
-- previous choice.
--
-- Every failure carries the conflict set that caused it: the packages
-- whose assignment the failure depends on. A rejected dependency blames
-- the package it wanted and the candidate's own package; an exhausted
-- goal blames everything its candidates blamed together with the
-- dependents that fixed its range, and drops itself. When the search
-- under a candidate of @p@ fails without blaming @p@, no other version or
-- flag assignment of @p@ can help, so the remaining ones are skipped and
-- the failure travels on to the package that is to blame. Without this a
-- single doomed goal deep in the order is re-derived once per combination
-- of the irrelevant choices above it, which is how @process@ and its
-- @os-string@ flag used to exhaust the backtrack limit.
--
-- The search is deterministic, so the same inputs give the same plan.
--
-- Only automatic flags that guard a @build-depends@ clause are searched.
-- Every other flag takes its default or its constraint, since no assignment
-- of it can make the plan fail.
