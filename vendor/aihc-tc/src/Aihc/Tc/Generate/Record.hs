-- | Record syntax support. The type checker expands record construction,
-- record update, and record patterns into positional constructor syntax
-- before it checks them. GHC does the same expansion in its type checker.
--
-- The head of the syntax is a data constructor or a record pattern
-- synonym. Both expand the same way, because a bidirectional pattern
-- synonym binds its builder under its own name and matches through a
-- constructor pattern, so only the field order differs.
