-- | Top-level constraint solver.

-- The solver uses the worklist/inert-set architecture from OutsideIn(X):
--
-- @
-- while worklist is non-empty:
--   pop constraint from worklist
--   canonicalize it
--   attempt to solve
--   either:
--     - solve it (fill evidence)
--     - add to inert set
--     - emit new work items
