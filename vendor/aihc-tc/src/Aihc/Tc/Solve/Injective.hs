-- | Improvement from type family injectivity.
--
-- An injectivity annotation @type family F a b = r | r -> a@ promises that
-- the result of the family determines the argument @a@. A wanted equality
-- whose one side is a saturated application of such a family may therefore
-- determine that argument, which solves meta variables that the equality
-- itself cannot solve: a family application is opaque, so the solver never
-- decomposes it.
--
-- Two rules produce the improvement:
--
--   * two applications of the same family are equal only if they agree on
--     the injective arguments, so @F t1 t2 ~ F s1 s2@ equates @t1@ and
--     @s1@;
--   * an equation @F p1 p2 = rhs@ is the only way the family can reach
--     @rhs@, so @F t1 t2 ~ rhs@ equates @t1@ with the pattern @p1@ under
--     the substitution that matches @rhs@.
--
-- Like functional dependency improvement this produces equalities, never
-- evidence: the equality constraint itself is still solved afterwards, by
-- reduction or by a given.
--
-- The annotation is taken on trust. GHC checks that the equations of a
-- family really are injective in the arguments the annotation names; aihc
-- does not, so a wrong annotation makes the solver derive a wrong equality
-- rather than report the annotation.
