-- | How the field of a constructor uses the last parameter of its datatype.
--
-- @Functor@, @Foldable@ and @Traversable@ are derived over the last
-- parameter of a datatype: the instance head drops it, and every field is
-- rewritten in terms of what it does with it. A field either ignores the
-- parameter, is the parameter, or is a type applied to something that uses
-- it -- and in the last case the derived body hands the work to the
-- instance of that type, so the context needs it.
--
-- The three classes differ only in the code they write for each of those
-- cases, so the analysis is here and each generator reads it.
