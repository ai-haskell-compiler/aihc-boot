-- | The library names that generated deriving code refers to, and the
-- classes that stock deriving knows.
--
-- A derived instance is ordinary surface syntax, so its method bodies
-- mention library values and types such as @True@, @(:)@, or @Int#@. The
-- type checker does not know where those live: the compiler that embeds it
-- says so through a 'DerivingReferences' table in its configuration. Class
-- methods such as @(==)@ or @showsPrec@ need no entry, because the class
-- being derived says where they are.
--
-- A reference names its module and gives the /source/ of its package rather
-- than a package identity, because the configuration is written once and a
-- package identity is only known while compiling: the primitive package is
-- the one of the configuration, and a helper that belongs to a class comes
-- from wherever that class was found. Only the first kind exists today, but
-- the classes of GHC that aihc does not generate code for yet -- @Lift@ in
-- the Template Haskell package, @Generic@ and @Data@ in the base one --
-- have their helpers next to themselves, outside the primitive package.
--
-- A reference of that kind has to be one the module deriving the class can
-- already see. Only an identity a module imports, or that a module it
-- imports re-exports, is in its type environment, so these name the types
-- and the constructors a user of the class handles rather than the
-- combinators of a library module they would have no reason to import.
