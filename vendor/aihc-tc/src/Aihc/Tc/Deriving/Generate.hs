-- | Write derived instances as surface instance declarations.

-- A deriving plan with a resolved context becomes an ordinary
-- @instance ctx => C (T a) where ...@ whose method equations are built here
-- from the checked constructor layout of the datatype. The declaration then
-- goes through the same instance checker and System FC lowering as source,
-- so no later phase needs to know that it was derived.
--
-- Generated names carry resolver annotations, the way the resolver would
-- have left them: constructors and methods point at their defining module,
-- pattern variables are locals with uniques that no resolver local uses, and
-- library values come from the 'DerivingReferences' of the configuration.

-- | The @Enum@ methods of an enumeration, in the shape GHC derives them.
--
-- Only a datatype whose constructors all have no fields can be enumerated,
-- so a constructor with a field is reported rather than given a body it
-- could not write. The constructors are numbered from zero in declaration
-- order, which is the numbering 'Bounded' and 'Ord' already agree with.
--
-- The tag is an unboxed literal on both sides, so neither direction needs a
-- numeric class: @fromEnum@ answers one boxed literal per constructor, and
-- @toEnum@ switches on the unboxed tag. Both are one equation group per
-- constructor rather than a chain of comparisons, so a @200@-constructor
-- enumeration costs a single switch.
--
-- An argument outside the enumeration matches no equation, which is the
-- runtime failure the compiler already reports for a case without a
-- matching alternative: @toEnum@ leaves the tags beside the enumeration
-- unmatched, and @succ@ and @pred@ the two ends. A datatype with a single
-- constructor has no step between neighbours at all, so it takes the class
-- defaults for @succ@ and @pred@, which fail through @toEnum@ instead.
--
-- @enumFrom@ and @enumFromThen@ are the two methods whose class defaults
-- run to the bounds of 'Int' rather than to the last constructor, so both
-- are written here against the constructors of the datatype.
