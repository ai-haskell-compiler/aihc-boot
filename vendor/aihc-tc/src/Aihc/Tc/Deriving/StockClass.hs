-- | What stock deriving knows about each class it can derive.
--
-- Stock deriving asks the same four questions of every class: which
-- extension a source clause needs before it may name the class, what a
-- @deriving@ clause without a strategy means for a newtype, which library
-- names the generated method bodies mention, and which bodies to write.
-- The answers used to be four separate lists spread over the strategy
-- check, the context inference, and the generator, so a class added to one
-- and forgotten in another looked supported until the generator refused it.
--
-- One row per class answers all four here. The row names the methods to
-- write as a tag rather than as a function, so that this module stays below
-- the generator: a row whose tag is new does not compile until the
-- generator handles it.
--
-- Where each class lives is deliberately not stated here. The type checker
-- knows no library, so the package and the module of a class reach it
-- through the 'Aihc.Tc.Deriving.References.DerivingReferences' of the
-- configuration, and a name below is only a class once that table agrees.
