-- | The identities of the type constructors and terms that the type checker
-- knows by name rather than from source.
--
-- Source syntax such as @(a, b)@ or @(# a, b #)@ names no module, so the
-- type checker cannot resolve it. Neither can it resolve the types it
-- reaches for on its own: the @Bool@ of a guard, the @Char@ of a character
-- literal, the list of a comprehension. The compiler that embeds the type
-- checker says where each of those lives through a 'TcWiring' table in its
-- configuration, the same way 'Aihc.Tc.Deriving.References' says where the
-- names of generated deriving code live.
--
-- The tuple tables are functions of the arity because a tuple family is
-- infinite and its members need not share one naming scheme: the aihc core
-- libraries call the boxed ones @Unit@, @Solo@, @Tuple2@, and so on.

    -- arity, such as @BoxedRep@, @Lifted@ or @IntRep@.

    -- ordinary family. Like the classes below these need no package.
